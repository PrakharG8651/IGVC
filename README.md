My attempt to solve Q1 Minimum Moves to Complete a Round
I have used all possible moves but in a priorotised way so that useless moves will be avoided as I stop the program once it reaches its destination.
Unfortunately my program isn't still able to complete the task, it gets stuck in the last part and I am trying to resolve it.
